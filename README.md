# Hello Welcome To My Project 1 About Kid Cudi

1.I chose Kid CUdi as my theme.
2.I picked my searches by just taking tweets from Kid Cudi's page on twitter.
3.Three issues I had was getting tweets to show, dissecting the json information, and fixing the centering for my html file. I fixed these problems by looking up documentation and calling on my friend for help.
4.There are currently no problems with my project.
5.I would make it incorporate more things about Kid Cudi and not just his tweets.
