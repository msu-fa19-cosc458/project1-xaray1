# Hello Welcome To My Project 1 About Kid Cudi

1.I chose Kid CUdi as my theme.
2.I picked my searches by just taking tweets from Kid Cudi's page on twitter.
3.Three issues I had was getting tweets to show, dissecting the json information, and fixing the centering for my html file. I fixed these problems by looking up documentation and calling on my friend for help.
4.The only problem I have is that the link to genius is not centered.
5.I would make it incorporate more things about Kid Cudi and not just his tweets.
